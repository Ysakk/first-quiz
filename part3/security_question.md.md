# System Security - First Quiz - Part 3

## Security Audit Using the OWASP Top 10

### System Overview
* Mobile app for Android and iOS
* Web frontend written in Javascript with Next.js
* MySQL database storing customer information and order information
* Python backend implemented in FastAPI

### OWASP Top 10
* #### A1: Injection

    Review your codebase for potential SQL, NoSQL, and command injection vulnerabilities, especially in your Python backend. Use parameterized queries or Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tools to prevent injection attacks.
* #### A2: Broken Authentication and Session Management 

    Ensure that user authentication is implemented securely, especially in the mobile app and web frontend. Use strong authentication mechanisms, like OAuth, and employ secure password storage and transmission. Implement rate limiting and account lockout policies to protect against brute force attacks.
* #### A3: Sensitive Data Exposure

    Check for vulnerabilities that could expose sensitive data such as customer passwords, home addresses, and telephone numbers.
* #### A4: XML External Entities (XXE)

    Review your application's XML processing to prevent XXE attacks. Disable XML external entity processing in relevant libraries, and validate XML input to ensure it does not contain malicious entities.
* #### A5: Broken Access Control

    Implement strong access controls and ensure that user roles and permissions are properly enforced. Regularly audit and monitor access to sensitive customer information and restrict access to the principle of least privilege.
* #### A6: Security Misconfigurations

    Check for security misconfigurations in the Kubernetes containers, ensuring they follow security best practices. Implement least privilege access for employees and regularly scan for misconfigurations in your environment. Check for the Amazon Web Services infrastructure, and the MySQL database too.
* #### A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

    Sanitize user input and implement output encoding to prevent XSS attacks, especially in the web frontend. Use security libraries and frameworks that provide automatic encoding of output.
* #### A8: Insecure Deserialization

   Ensure that deserialization is done securely and avoid using objects from untrusted sources. Implement input validation and use safe serialization libraries, especially in the Python Backend.
* #### A9: Using Known Vulnerable Components

    Check for known vulnerable components in the Python backend, the web frontend, the mobile app, and the Kubernetes containers.
* #### A10: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

    Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents. Create alerts for suspicious activities and regularly review logs for potential issues. Consider using a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution for more advanced monitoring.

### Additional Recommendations

In addition to the above, I would also look for the following:

* Implement secure coding practices.
* Perform a threat modeling exercise.
* Conduct regular security testing of the system.

### Security Measures

I would also implement the following security measures:

* Implement least privilege.
* Implement defense in depth.
* Implement security monitoring.
